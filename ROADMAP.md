# magnetar roadmap

## Things planned for version 0.0.6 (bugfix release)

- [ ] Running any command/game/app spawns a powershell window which should be invisible to the user
- [ ] Applications are not starting if at least one instance of them is already running

## Things planned for version 0.0.7

- [ ] Linux support
- [ ] Working settings with theme, language, keybind etc.
- [ ] A magnetar website with documentation
- [ ] Minor UI fixes, for example the search bar closes much faster on page change than the page itself is able to load
- [ ] When adding a new application and selecting a shortcut with the proper app name, the application name is the name of the executable, which it was pointing to which does not match
- [ ] Move the magnetar window above the taskbar (currently magnetar uses bottom padding to avoid the window from being covered by the taskbar)
- [ ] Remove the default fade in/out animationa when opening/hiding the window
- [ ] Improve the search bar design
