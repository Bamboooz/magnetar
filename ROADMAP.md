# magnetar roadmap

## Things planned for version 0.0.6

- [x] Running any command/game/app spawns a powershell window which should be invisible to the user
- [x] Applications are not starting if at least one instance of them is already running
- [x] Allow using .lnk files as applications, to have the propper application name
- [x] Move the magnetar window above the taskbar (currently magnetar uses bottom padding to avoid the window from being covered by the taskbar)
- [x] Remove the default fade in/out animations when opening/hiding the window

## Things planned for version 0.0.7

- [ ] Working settings with theme, language, keybind etc.
- [ ] A magnetar website with documentation
- [ ] Minor UI fixes, for example the search bar closes much faster on page change than the page itself is able to load
- [ ] Improve the search bar design
