# Goals for v0.0.5

- [ ] Split the code into enums and types folders for custom types and enums of course that are already inside the code. Generally, just try to improve the code even more.
- [ ] Add a working settings, currently only implement theme, language and visible functions.
- [ ] Add a folders tab, which allows you to save and quickly access your folders across your drives.
- [ ] Clipboard manager tab with image display and saving those to a file.
- [ ] Steam item price view with regression trend and some other analytics
- [ ] This is for like way future but at-runtime custom user plugins would be awesome
- [ ] An audio tab which allows you to change some audio settings, maybe play with pitch etc.
- [ ] Improve the UI/UX of the apps page as I am not that happy with it.
- [ ] Possible UI animations such as the pads under current tab jumping to the selected one, or the search par having a smooth expansion, closing animation.
- [ ] Some optimizations if possible, the app struggles with the loading time which can be preety long, only the issue at startup though.
- [ ] Adding/removing commands dirrectly within the app, so the user doesn't have to edit the commands.json file themselves, but that will not be removed.
- [ ] Remove more from apps and games, use purely context menu to manage them
- [ ] System information tab
- [x] Add checking for updates
- [x] Fixed home page buttons leading to magnetar page and my github profile as i forgot to connect the url open function to them
- [x] Add a separate dropdown for game platforms in the game module and support other ones apart of steam
- [x] Fix wrong padding in the commands tab
- [ ] If possible, make the app display itself above the menu bar and not just push the padding as this will not work if the user has a different menu bar size
- [ ] Context menu hover also hovers the item behind it
- [ ] Website for the app
- [ ] Fix cmd's spawning in places where they shouldn't e.g. opening games
